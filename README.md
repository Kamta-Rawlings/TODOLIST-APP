## About Laravel
Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects


## Login Logic
After setting up laravel globally, and making sure you have composer, node, npm and a database, we run the following commands.

### composer create-project laravel/laravel "TODOLIST-APP"
This command helps to create  a new project

### composer require laravel/ui
### php artisan ui vue --
These commands helps to create the login UI.

The project was later connected to our database and the following command was used to populate the db.
### php artisan migrate

The login ui was fixed to have a username and mailstrap.io was used to send emails.
